                    or double elimination format.<br/> It's basically a digital version of printyourbrackets.com.</p>

                    initiate the tournament,<br/> and share the tournament ID with other participants through a common chat platform or QR code.<br/> The winner of each match can then be marked within
                    the application, updating instantly for everyone.</p>

            <li>
                <strong>Q: Can you explain the order of players in the brackets?</strong><br/>
                <p>A: The players in the brackets are shuffled randomly using a cryptographically strong random number generator, to ensure fairness.<br/> However, players can be manually rearranged
                    using the "rename" functionality, if needed.</p>
            </li>

                <strong>Q: Can anyone edit the tournament?</strong><br/>
                <p>A: The tournament can be shared in either read-only or read-write mode.<br/> The editing codes can be found in the menu by long-tapping on the QR code.<br/> The tournament can only
                    be viewed by people having the reader code and only edited (e.g., to select a winner) by ones having the 3 digit writer code as well.</p>

            </li>

                <strong>Q: Is a stable internet connection required for the app to function properly?</strong><br/>
                <p>A: A stable internet connection is recommended for all players who are editing the tournament, to avoid overriding any changes.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Q: How many players or teams can participate in the tournament?</strong><br/>

                <strong>Q: Can I check which game's loser will be my opponent in the loser bracket?</strong><br/>

            <li>
                <strong>Q: Is the average time for games accurate if multiple games are played in parallel?</strong><br/>
                <p>A: The average time assumes that games are played sequentially.<br/> If multiple games are played in parallel, the actual average time should be multiplied accordingly.<br/> For
                    example, if the displayed average time is 5 minutes per game and two games are played in parallel,<br/> the actual average time is 10 minutes.</p>
